#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a 
#motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list 
#to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a 
#Honda motorcycle.” 

vehicle = ['BMW X5', 'Skoda Kylaq', '91 Invictus', 'Range Rover Defender']
print(f'I would like to own a {vehicle[0]} in future.')
print(f"I will buy a {vehicle[1]} after completing my degree.")
print(f'I like to ride my {vehicle[2]} on weekends.')
print(f'{vehicle[-1]} is best off road vehicle.')
