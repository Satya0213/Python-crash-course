# Python Crash Course – Practice Repository

This repository contains my Python practice code while learning Python fundamentals.
The exercises are organized chapter-wise, following a structured learning approach.

The goal of this repository is to build strong Python basics through consistent practice
and gradually move towards more advanced topics and open-source contributions.
